       "description" :"Faster and Better are two words that are constantly heard in the development world. Apps need to be built quicker, perform better and be scalable. This has resulted in technologies such as React and Redux to be created.So, what are React and Redux?React JS is an open-source JavaScript library that works as the V in the Model-View-Controller, allowing the system to render components that has additional components written as custom HTML tags. It allows incorporating HTML tags to make the developer’s coding more flexible. Using a JavaScript syntax extension, known as JSX, the coding is more readable and easier to write.       Redux is slightly different. Although, inspired from Facebook’s Flux technology, it is not at all the same. Instead, Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It allows the developer to write apps regardless of the environment, resulting in more consistently running apps. It works by storing the whole app in an object tree inside a single store. In order for a change to be made, an action is emitted, which does not result in the state of the app to be changed but rather a new object to be returned. The developer writes a reducer, a special function, which determines how an action will modify the state of the entire application. This made the app easier to run and even test."

        "description":"*** As seen on Kickstarter ***Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there: 1. ROBUST STRUCTURE The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it. That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.2. INTUITION TUTORIALSSo many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.3. EXCITING PROJECTSAre you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problemConvolutional Neural Networks for Image RecognitionRecurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock PricesSelf-Organizing Maps to investigate FraudBoltzmann Machines to create a Recomender SystemStacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize  *Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth. 4. HANDS-ON CODING In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means. In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after. This is a course which naturally extends into your career. "

I've dedicated part of this course to teaching the basic knowledge needed to complete this course.  You'll learn how to install the engine, how to add objects to your new projects, and even how to navigate the engine and edit levels!Once you learn the basics, or if you already have some experience, we'll hop into learning all of UE5s cinematic tools!  I'll teach you how to use the Cinematic camera, which is created to simulate a real movie camera, as well as the virtual rail rig, and crane rig tools to achieve realistic and professional camera movement.After learning those tools, we'll animate our cameras to create a full 4 shot cutscene using all the different animation methods.  We'll edit all our shots together, then add camera shake, activate particle simulations for added detail, add multiple sound effects, as well as play and blend character animations to bring our cutscene to life.I'll even show you how to activate and manipulate your cutscene using Blueprint visual scripting!"
